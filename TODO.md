- Use a proper MVC structure in the code
- `up` and `down`:
    - Show the name (and type?) of each task?
    - Show gold, XP, mana, & health acquired/lost
    - Add a blank line between task responses?
    - Don't show boss damage when not on a quest (despite the API returning it
      anyway)
- `status`: Include alias names in output
- Find where the API is currently storing collection quest deltas & progress
- Add To-Do management
- Add options for controlling log level/verbosity
- Prettify cron output
- Give more commands `--show-json` options?
- Format quest progress nicely
- Write a README
- Add a command for listing tasks with their IDs?
